# Usage: bash

#sort out the candidates: the presence of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase (McrA) gene& more copies of HSP70 gene

#Your script should include all of the necessary steps to search each genome for the genes of interest and should produce a summary table collating the results of all searches. 

#1) use Muscle to make alignment of those genes
#2)hmmbuild: align in hmm out;
#3)hmmsearch: find and match
